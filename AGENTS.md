# Instructions for the agent

Read this file at the start of every session. Keep it short and correct; update it when the project changes.

## Project
<!-- One or two sentences: what the app does and for whom. Link SPEC.md. -->
See `SPEC.md` for goals, non-goals and acceptance criteria.
Lab Booking: students book a lab workstation for a whole-hour slot, staff manage labs and see all bookings. Stack: Node.js 20, Express, SQLite.

## Commands
<!-- How to install, run, test. Keep these exact and working. -->
- Install: `npm install`
- Run: `npm start` (serves http://localhost:3000)
- Test: `npm test`
- Coverage: `npm run coverage`
- MCP server: `npm run mcp`

## Conventions
<!-- Folder layout, naming, where business rules live, how errors are returned to the client. -->
- Folders: `src/routes/` (HTTP handlers), `src/services/` (business rules), `src/data/` (the only place with SQL), `src/views/` (EJS templates), `src/ai/` (model client), `db/` (migrations and seed), `mcp-server/`, `test/`.
- Naming: camelCase in JavaScript, snake_case for columns, plural table names (`labs`, `workstations`, `bookings`, `users`).
- Business rules (overlaps, past times, the limit of 3, roles) live only in services; route handlers and MCP tools never repeat them.
- Errors: the API returns `{ "error": "<readable sentence>" }` with status 400, 401, 403, 404 or 409; pages show the same sentence, never a stack trace.
- Schema changes go in a new numbered file in `db/migrations/`; never edit one that has already run.
- Every test title starts with its acceptance criterion id, for example `AC-1 ...`.

## Layers
<!-- Fill in the file or folder for each layer. -->
Requests arrive two ways and both end in the same place:

- HTTP route handler → service → data access → database
- MCP tool → **the same service** → data access → database
- Route handlers: `src/routes/`; services: `src/services/`; data access: `src/data/`; MCP tools: `mcp-server/`.

A route handler reads the request and turns a result into a status code. A service holds the
rules and knows nothing about HTTP or about MCP. Only the data layer writes SQL. An MCP tool
that talks to the database directly is a second, unguarded way into your data: never add one.

## The model feature
<!-- Provider, env var, and the call site. -->
- The provider is named in exactly one file: `src/ai/assistant.js`
- The key comes from an environment variable and is never committed or logged.
- Every call has a timeout and a deterministic fallback, so the app still works when the provider is down or rate-limited.
- The model's output is re-checked against real data before anything is saved or shown.
- Tests never call the provider: they pass in a fake client.

## The MCP server
<!-- Where it lives and how it authenticates. -->
- Lives in `mcp-server/`, grew out of Exercise 1.
- Every tool calls a service function; none touches the data layer or the database directly.
- It carries a user, and enforces exactly the same authorization rules as the HTTP API.
- Adding a tool means adding a row to the table in `SPEC.md` too.

## Tests and coverage
- Every acceptance criterion in `SPEC.md` has an id like `AC-3`, and a test whose title contains that id.
- The coverage gate runs in CI: 100% of the service layer, 80% overall.
- A test is evidence. Changing a test so the code passes destroys the evidence.

## Always ask before
- deleting files or folders
- editing a migration that has already run
- installing or removing dependencies
- pushing, tagging or changing CI
- anything that touches secrets or `.env`
- changing an authentication or authorization rule
- adding, renaming or removing an MCP tool
- changing a coverage threshold
- sending user data to a third-party model

## Never
- commit secrets, passwords, API keys or an OAuth client secret
- weaken or delete a test to make it pass
- lower a coverage threshold or switch off a CI job to make the build green
- add an MCP tool that reaches past the service layer
- log a prompt that contains somebody's personal data
